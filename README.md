Fast Forward the battle animation 


This simple extension automatically fast forwards the battle animation.

It will start when the battle begins (Directly after the black screen)
and it will end when you can take action (The Fight/Run buttons are available)

The speed will be set to 6400% and then set back to the original speed you were playing at
